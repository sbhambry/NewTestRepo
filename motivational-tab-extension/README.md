# Motivational Tab Extension

A ridiculously silly Chrome extension that motivates you every time you open a new tab!

## Features

- Random motivational (and hilarious) quotes
- Animated emojis that bounce with enthusiasm
- Beautiful gradient background
- "Give me MORE motivation!" button for when one quote isn't enough
- Pure joy and encouragement

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `motivational-tab-extension` folder
5. Open a new tab and get MOTIVATED!

## How to Use

1. Open a new tab (Ctrl+T or Cmd+T)
2. Bask in the glory of your motivational message
3. Need more motivation? Click the button!
4. Repeat as needed throughout your day

## Customization

Want to add your own silly quotes? Edit the `quotes` array in `script.js`!

Want different emojis? Update the `emojis` array in `script.js`!

Want different colors? Modify the gradients in `styles.css`!

## Note on Icons

This extension references icon files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) in the manifest. These are optional for functionality, but if you want custom icons:

1. Create PNG images at those sizes
2. Place them in the extension folder
3. Make them something motivational (like a flexing arm or a rocket)

The extension will work perfectly fine without them!

Free to use, modify, and share. Go forth and motivate!
